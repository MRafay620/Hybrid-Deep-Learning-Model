# Hybrid Deep Learning for Diabetes Detection Using Explainable AI and Personalized Disease and Diet Management

## Project Overview
Diabetes is a major public health challenge due to its high prevalence and severe complications. This project proposes a hybrid approach using deep learning models to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of early diabetes detection. The hybrid models combine Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks with Explainable AI techniques like SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations).

## Features
- **Hybrid Deep Learning Models:** Utilizes CNN-Bi-LSTM, Bi-LSTM-FNN, and Bi-LSTM-LSTM architectures.
- **Explainable AI:** Implements SHAP to provide insights into feature importance and model predictions.
- **Personalized Disease and Diet Management:** Offers personalized diet plans and insulin reminders.
- **Integration with Web and Mobile Applications:** Provides a user-friendly platform for early diabetes prediction and management.


## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:**
    - Ensure that the datasets are preprocessed correctly.
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.
